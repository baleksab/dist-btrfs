API Reference
=============

Information
----------------

This API reference is built automatically by using the sphinxcontrib.openapi extension.

It utilizes the openapi specification, and based on it it generates the data in the following sections. 

The plugin is currently lacking in support when it comes to openapi v3. 

Thats the reason why there might be missing data when it comes to request and response dtos. 

Controllers
